Christopher Nolan's masterpiece that explores the concept of shared dreaming and the blurring lines between reality and dreams.

## Why I Love It

The intricate plot structure, stunning visuals, and Hans Zimmer's iconic score make this one of my all-time favorite films. The ending still sparks debates to this day.

<Spoiler title="Plot Spoilers Ahead!">

### The Ending Explained

The final scene with the spinning top remains deliberately ambiguous. Does it fall or keep spinning? 

Cobb seeing his children's faces suggests he's finally in reality, but the top continuing to spin implies it might still be a dream. Nolan leaves it to interpretation - what matters is that Cobb no longer cares, he's chosen his reality.

### The Real Twist

The entire movie might be an "inception" performed on Cobb himself - planting the idea that he needs to let go of Mal.
