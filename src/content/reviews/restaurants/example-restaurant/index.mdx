A Toronto gem serving authentic Northern Thai dishes that transport you straight to Chiang Mai.

## Must-Try Dishes

- **Khao Soi** - Their signature curry noodle soup with crispy noodle topping
- **Pad Thai** - Classic done right with the perfect balance of sweet, sour, and savory
- **Mango Sticky Rice** - The perfect ending to any meal

## The Experience

The atmosphere is vibrant and bustling, much like the street food stalls of Thailand. The open kitchen lets you see the woks blazing as dishes come together.

## Tips

Book ahead or be prepared to wait - this place is popular for good reason! The Duncan Street location is my favorite.
