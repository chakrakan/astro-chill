Nintendo's revolutionary take on the Zelda formula, giving players unprecedented freedom to explore Hyrule.

## What Makes It Special

- **True open world** - Climb anything, go anywhere from the start
- **Physics-based puzzles** - Multiple solutions to every challenge
- **Emergent gameplay** - The systems interact in surprising ways
- **Gorgeous art style** - Timeless visuals that still look amazing

## The Freedom Factor

The first time you leave the Great Plateau and realize the entire world is yours to explore is unforgettable. You can literally go fight the final boss immediately if you're skilled (and brave) enough.

## Memorable Moments

Discovering a hidden Korok, stumbling upon a dragon for the first time, or solving a shrine in an unintended way - hundreds of hours later, there are still surprises to discover.

## Pro Tip

Don't rush to the main objectives - the joy is in the journey and discovery! Some of the best experiences come from getting sidetracked.
