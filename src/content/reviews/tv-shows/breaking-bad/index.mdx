Vince Gilligan's epic tale of Walter White's transformation from a mild-mannered chemistry teacher to a ruthless drug kingpin.

## Why I Love It

The character development is unmatched. Watching Walter White's descent into darkness while Bryan Cranston delivers a career-defining performance is television at its finest.

### The Ozymandias Episode

When Hank is killed and Walt loses everything he built, it's the culmination of 5 seasons of tension. The phone call scene where Walt "threatens" Skyler while actually clearing her name is acting at its absolute peak.

### The Finale

Walt admitting to Skyler that he did it all for himself - "I liked it. I was good at it." - is the moment of brutal honesty that makes the ending so satisfying.

### Jesse's Escape

After everything Jesse went through, watching him drive away laughing and crying is pure catharsis.
