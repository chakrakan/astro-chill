title: 'Google Antigravity vs Cursor — One Shot Test'

description: "My initial impressions of Google's new IDE vs Cursor"
---

Google Antigravity and Cursor are AI-powered IDEs designed for agentic coding workflows. 
Antigravity emphasizes autonomous agents managed centrally, while Cursor offers developer-controlled
multi-agent parallelism in a VS Code fork.
​
### Core Technology

Antigravity uses Gemini 3 Pro exclusively with over 1 million token context, scoring high on benchmarks 
like 1487 Elo on WebDev Arena. Cursor employs a proprietary Composer model optimized for speed, completing 
tasks in about 30 seconds, and supports multiple models like OpenAI and Anthropic.

With that said, today's comparison is going to just be the first test among various other tests that we might be able to perform.
This one's going to be a very basic test, just the *one-shot prompt*.

Given we are within an agentic development workflow revolution, and we're kind of moving deeper in this direction, I've been using Cursor heavily at work for a little over six months now.
I have some optimizations, MCPs, and just general rules that I use. However, given this website was just sitting in the corner, ignored, there's been no special setup that's been done for this particular repository.

As far as I'm concerned, this will be a test that features:
1. Opening up the blog repository across both Anti-Gravity and Cursor.
2. Writing a single prompt that will add multiple sections to my website. So previously it was just a blog but we will be adding the reviews and travel sections that you should see by the time this blog post is up.
3. Going through the same process for both IDEs, and here we'll be careful to use the exact same configurations, AKA the same models and the same prompt.
4. Compare the outputs.

Anti-Gravity is currently available for public preview which gives us access to most models (with rate limits), so I didn't have to pay for that, whereas I am paying for Cursor's $20 pro plan to access the better models.
The model I chose for both the comparisons is Claude's Opus 4.5. And as for configurations, nothing was configured on Anti-Gravity nor on Cursor. Both are completely new sessions/chats, and we treat this as the starting point for both IDEs.

With that said, let's begin the review.

### UI

Both of these IDEs are forks of VS Code, but for some reason, and maybe this is just recency bias since I've spent more time on Cursor, I found that the UI and general experience for just overall responsiveness, clicking around, and keeping track of things, Cursor takes the cake.
That said, of course, with Antigravity, Google is trying to redefine essentially how we go about doing modern development. There is an expected learning curve for this UI.
