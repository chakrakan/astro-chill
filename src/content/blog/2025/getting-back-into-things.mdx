## Welcoming myself back

It's been a while!

Personally, there was a lot going on since I last posted, and it was time I really had to take a step back and prioritize a lot of different things that I never really had to prioritize previously in my life. 

> So I did exactly that.

I've had lots of growth, development, learnings, changes in perspective, and more generally, new insights that I believe one only gets to truly appreciate once they take a step back to see the bigger picture. 


With that said, I would like to welcome myself back to this blog which kind of got left in the dust. 
We can get right back into things where we left off, and boy do I have updates.

There are no grandeur promises of sticking to any particular cadences, but I would like to be more consistent here. So do expect more discussions on the various topics that are coming up in my day-to-day life.

## Personal Updates

> 2024 was a big year for me!

<Highlight variant="celebration">I got married! 💍🎉</Highlight>

And amongst other things, got a new gig 💼, traveled a whole bunch, took some time off from just dev things (aka the "grind"), 
started taking care of my own health and got heavily involved in various raquet sports, and also checked off home-ownership 🏡 and other milestones in my life along the way.

  <Image alt="Pickleball" class="rounded-lg" src={Pickleball} />
</div>

One could say that priorities shifted for me, and I got used to this shift moving into 2025. 

Work kept things interesting so I could scratch my development itches there, and then have a clear separation for my personal time with friends, family, and loved ones.

However, things have been changing for better or worse (TBD) within the tech ecosystem over the past few years, and as of recent, exponentially!

And it is increasingly difficult to not come back here when I have so many cool things to tinker with on a day-to-day basis and share my thoughts, learnings, explorations, and opinions with those who may (not) be concerned.
