## A Meditation on Mastery

This documentary isn't just about sushi—it's about the pursuit of perfection.

### The Story

Jiro Ono has been making sushi for over 70 years. His tiny 10-seat restaurant in a Tokyo subway station has earned 3 Michelin stars. The documentary explores his philosophy and the incredible dedication required to reach his level of mastery.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Shokunin** - The Japanese concept of the artisan. Someone who dedicates their life to perfecting their craft.

2. **Never stop improving** - Even at 85, Jiro says he still hasn't achieved perfection.

3. **Simplicity is hard** - What looks simple (a piece of fish on rice) is actually the culmination of decades of practice.

### The Visuals

Director David Gelb shoots the sushi like works of art. Each piece is filmed with such reverence that watching becomes an almost meditative experience.

### My Only Critique

The film touches on some complex family dynamics that could have been explored further. Jiro's sons essentially have no choice but to follow in his footsteps.

A must-watch for anyone interested in food, craftsmanship, or Japanese culture.
