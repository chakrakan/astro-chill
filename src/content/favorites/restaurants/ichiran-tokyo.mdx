## The Ultimate Ramen Experience

Ichiran is unlike any other ramen shop. The focus is entirely on you and your bowl of ramen.

### The Concept

You sit in individual booths separated by partitions. A bamboo blind separates you from the kitchen. You fill out a preference sheet for everything from broth richness to noodle firmness. Then, your personalized bowl of Tonkotsu ramen is placed before you.

### Why It Works

The lack of distractions forces you to focus entirely on the food. No phones, no conversation—just you and the ramen. It's surprisingly meditative.

### The Ramen

- **Broth**: Rich, creamy tonkotsu (pork bone) broth that's been simmering for hours
- **Noodles**: Thin, firm noodles that hold the broth perfectly
- **Chashu**: Tender, melt-in-your-mouth pork
- **Their Secret Sauce**: A spicy red sauce that elevates everything

### Tips for First-Timers

1. Get the extra-rich broth
2. Order extra noodles (kae-dama) when you're halfway through
3. Try the half-boiled egg add-on

A pilgrimage spot for any ramen lover visiting Japan.
