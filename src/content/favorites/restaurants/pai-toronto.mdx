## The Best Thai Food in Toronto

If you're looking for authentic Northern Thai food in Toronto, look no further than Pai.

### The Atmosphere

Walking in, you're immediately transported to Thailand. The décor features traditional Thai elements mixed with a modern, upscale vibe. It gets busy on weekends, so reservations are recommended.

### Must-Try Dishes

1. **Khao Soi** - Their signature dish. Egg noodles in a rich, creamy curry soup topped with crispy noodles. Absolutely heavenly.

2. **Pad Kra Pao** - Holy basil stir-fry with your choice of protein. Get it with crispy pork belly.

3. **Mango Sticky Rice** - The perfect sweet ending. When mangoes are in season, this is a must.

### The Details

- **Price Range**: $$-$$$
- **Best For**: Date night, special occasions
- **Pro Tip**: The lunch specials are great value

This is my go-to spot when I'm craving Thai food. I've been here at least 10 times and it never disappoints.
